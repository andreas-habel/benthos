## Fields

### `endpoint`

Sorry! This field is missing documentation.


Type: `object`  

### `endpoint.queue_name`

Sorry! This field is missing documentation.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

queue_name: my/queue
```

### `transport`

Transport object allows to configure connection informations like hostname


Type: `object`  

### `transport.host`

Host is an IPv4 or IPv6 address or host name of the broker to which to connect. Multiple entries are permitted when each address is separated by a comma. The entry for the Host property should provide a protocol, host and port.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

host: tcp://localhost:55555

host: tcps://localhost:55443
```

### `transport.keep_alive_interval`

KeepAliveInterval is the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait between sending out Keep-Alive messages.


Type: `int`  
Default: `32000`  

### `transport.connection_retries`

connection_retries is how many times to try connecting to a broker during connection setup.


Type: `int`  
Default: `5`  

### `transport.retries_per_host`

connection_retries_per_host defines how many connection or reconnection attempts are made to a single host before moving to the next host in the list, when using a host list.


Type: `int`  
Default: `3`  

### `transport.reconnection_attempts`

Reconnection Attempts is the number reconnection attempts to the broker (or list of brokers) after a connected MessagingService goes down.
Zero means no automatic reconnection attempts, while a -1 means attempt to reconnect forever. The default valid range is greather than or equal to -1.
When using a host list, each time the API works through the host list without establishing a connection is considered a
reconnection retry. Each reconnection retry begins with the first host listed. After each unsuccessful attempt to reconnect
to a host, the API waits for the amount of time set for `reconnection_attempts_wait_interval` before attempting another
connection to a broker. The number of times attempted to connect to one broker before moving on to the
next listed host is determined by the value set for `connection_retries_per_host`


Type: `int`  
Default: `-1`  

### `transport.reconnection_attempts_wait_interval`

reconnection_attempts_wait_iinterval sets how much time (in milliseconds) to wait between each connection or reconnection attempt to the configured host.
If a connection or reconnection attempt to the configured host (which may be a list) is not successful, the API waits for
the amount of time set for reconnection_attempts_wait_interval, and then makes another connection or reconnection attempt.
The valid range is greater than or equal to zero.


Type: `int`  
Default: `1000`  

### `service`

service properties allow to configure the message vpn to connect to and specific client behaviors


Type: `object`  

### `service.vpn_name`

ServicePropertyVPNName name of the Message VPN to attempt to join when connecting to a broker.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"default"`  

```yml
# Examples

vpn_name: default
```

### `service.generate_receive_timestamps`

__(Input only)__ receive_timestamps specifies whether timestamps should be generated on inbound messages.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `service.generate_sender_id`

__(Output only)__ generate_sender_id specifies whether the client name should be included in the SenderID message-header parameter.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `service.generate_send_timestamps`

__(Output only)__ generate_send_timestamps specifies whether timestamps should be generated for outbound messages.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`

Sorry! This field is missing documentation.


Type: `object`  

### `authentication.scheme`

AuthenticationPropertyScheme defines the keys for the authentication scheme type.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME_BASIC"`  
Options: `AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME_BASIC`, `AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE`, `AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME_GSS_KRB`, `AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME_OAUTH2`.

```yml
# Examples

scheme: AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME_BASIC
```
